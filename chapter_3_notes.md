# Chapter 3. Control Flow

- Mostly familiar control-flow options
- Pattern matching is a foreign concept for Rubyists/JSistss, but it's a very
  powerful way to work with return values
- Lots of discussion about lazy vs. eager

Discussion wandered, but these were the topics we covered:

- Enumerable and iterable are separated (verify)
- What does it mean to write idiomatic Elixir?
- Jokes about dereferencing from C++

- Protip: Don’t spread versions of the same function apart from one another! Decrease your cognitive load when reading.
- Protip: Make sure that catchall is at the end!

## Frustrating debugging experiences
Error messages are uncomfortable coming from Ruby, specifically guard error messaging

Occasionally had to trash the tutorial app due to undiagnosable errors.

Problematic errors might come from Erlang.

All the CS in the world doesn’t help you when the compiler gives bad errors.
