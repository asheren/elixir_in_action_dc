### ETS Tables (Ch. 10)

- Single process owning data can cause bottle neck

- ETS is a lower level and deals with simple data storage needs
  - Dont want to be restricted to one at a time data transaction
  - Overview of how to create them (use an api to put values into to table)
    - Weird that they are called rows and not key value pair

  - ETS or DTS seem like they could take up memory
  - Most equivalent to memcache in other language worlds
  - confusion around match_spec (i.e. head, guard, result)
